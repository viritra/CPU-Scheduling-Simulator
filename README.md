CPU SCHEDULING SIMULATOR: FCFS, SJF, RR algorithms
//CPU Scheduling Simulator --Discription
/*
# DEFINITION
CPU Scheduling is an operating system mechanism that decides which process gets the CPU and for how long when multiple processes are present in the ready queue.
# A CPU Scheduling Simulator is a program that imitates the working of different scheduling algorithms and calculates performance parameters such as:
1. Waiting Time (WT)
2. Turnaround Time (TAT)
3. Average Waiting Time
4. Average Turnaround Time

# TERMINOLOGIES
(a) Burst Time (BT):
The total time required by a process to execute on the CPU.
(b) Waiting Time (WT):
The total time a process waits in the ready queue before getting CPU.
WT=TAT−BT
(c) Turnaround Time (TAT)
Total time taken from process arrival to completion.
𝑇𝐴𝑇=𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒−𝐴𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑣𝑎𝑙 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒TAT=Completion Time−Arrival Time
(Arrival time is assumed as 0 in this simulator.)

# ROUND ROBIN
Each process gets a fixed time quantum
After quantum expires, process goes back to ready queue

#ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTED
FCFS (First Come First Serve)
SJF (Shortest Job First – Non-Preemptive)
Round Robin

#CONCEPTS USED
pid, burst time
Waiting Time & Turnaround Time calculation
